#Observation:  


#### Quote 
 <p>“ Education must not be what it has been, our children are tomorrow’s already. We must educate them openly in the world, without pretension of profession. Their world will not be the one we have known, we must create a world where we are not instilling yesterday’s knowledge but to create spaces in which tomorrow’s problem become visible”  Zachary Stein </p>




#### The role of Play in co-operation:
Real play is deep, absorbing and satisfying. An active childhood, with plenty of opportunity for play, develops the individual child in innumerable ways. Just as sunlight provides the body with vital nourishments, high quality play in childhood is nature’s vitamin for our whole sense of well being , we should not be complacent about the loss of play.Play is mischievously difficult to pin down.


#### Cooperation is an intrinsic phenomenon developed out of play.

Reflection:
Sarah Hardy’s thoughts ,“We began raising our young ones in large groups, co-operating with one another to shoulder the task of vulnerable infants into thriving adults. She draws from wide-ranging sources of evidence from the genetic to the endocrine to the archaeological, to argue that the origins of human sociality and our incredibly sophisticated theory of mind may be tied to the human practice of turning to multiple caregivers for support.”
Even Angela Garbes writes in her new book, " Essential Labor: Mothering as a Social Change" . Raising kids is “not a private hobby, not an individual duty,” she goes on. “It is a social responsibility, one that requires robust community support. The pandemic revealed that mothering is some of the only truly essential work humans do.”

#### Our Mission
#### “These micro communities would enable each community to design the circles in their own way overarching with our common set of beliefs. This would generate local coordination, trust and employment in the local community.Through this model we are remixing historical Cooperative Organization models with decentralized Web3 needs.”

This space we are creating is a space of reflection and action. We are trying to create an economy based on the local community’s needs. So we encourage you to participate. We believe that on-the-ground community economic experimentation will provide us the inspiration and guidance needed. Our aim is to build complex adaptive systems for parenting communities attuned to the needs of the people and little humans participating in it.
The late John Lewis said,  
 ending the essay with these words:
<p>“ I urge you to answer the highest calling of your heart and stand up for what you truly believe. In my life I have done all I can to demonstrate that the way of peace, the way of love and nonviolence is the more excellent way. Now it is your turn to let freedom ring.”</p>
