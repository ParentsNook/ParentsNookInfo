#### “There can be no keener revelation of society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children”.  Nelson Mandela.


We are re imagining neighborhood parenting community by creating neighborhood care spaces for parents and children. These spaces we are creating are a space of reflection and action. These care-spaces for families are based on the local parenting community’s needs, we imagine this would be creating a local economy thriving through the public goods phenomenon. 
So we encourage you to participate. We believe that on-the-ground community experimentation will provide us the inspiration and guidance needed for taking the project ahead as per individual community’s needs. 
Our aim is to build complex adaptive systems for parenting communities attuned to the needs of the people and little humans participating in it. We believe that the first step to solve this problem is to enable parents and caregivers to create the care spaces in their own neighborhoods.

Nooks are the starting point of building the collaboration. In the next few pages we will walk you through how we are connecting the dots.
