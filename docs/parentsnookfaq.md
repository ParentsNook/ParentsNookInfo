## Welcome to Parents' Nook FAQ

We are glad you are here!!

Welcome! This site provides documentation, research and work we are doing for Parents' Nook and how we are remixing the collaborative models of Nooks with web3 needs. Its a work in progress.

If our work and research work interests you we would love to hear from you. Any feedback/suggestions are very much appreciated as we build together. Reach out to us play@parents-nook.com
