#### There are various ways through which you may want to participate in Nooks:

a)By requesting a Nook.  
b)By hosting a Nook for your community, workspaces and your business.  
c)By being a play-facilitator.  

We also ask you to join our community by subscribing to our website. We hate spams and love to keep the space intentional.

#### Parents can participate in Nooks in two basic ways:  

a)By requesting a Nook at a space of your choice. If you have a space of your own, and want to host a Nook there, we would love to help you set up a Nook.  
b) You can also request a Nook at any of the spaces where we are hosting the nook at that moment. If there are spaces available we would love to accomodate your family to that Nook.  


#### Community can also get more deeply involved in Nooks various other ways :  
a)Being the community Nook advisor to help potential hosts and arrange spaces.


  All being said we would like to emphasize that Nooks are collaborative effort between the space collaborators, parents and play facilitators.There can be many other ways to get involved. If you think you might want to get involved in any way, we would love to get in touch. Join our discord server or drop us an email play@parents-nook.com
