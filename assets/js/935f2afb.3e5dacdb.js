We\'re making use of existing spaces like cafes, coworking spaces, backyards, and community centers to achieve this and thus supporting these small businesses, communities, and public infrastructure facilities with our feet and dollars.  We believe that kids are an integral part of our day to day life and we can operate in a better way as a society to achieve it. Taking your kids to a meeting, finishing up your project without the need to find alternate childcare should be all easier and within your community. We are trying to connect the dots.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"What we do":{"id":"What we do","title":"What we do","description":"\u201cThere can be no keener revelation of society\u2019s soul than the way in which it treats its children\u201d.

We believe these care spaces are essential to the survival and well being of parents and children.These micro communities would enable each community to design the circles in their own way overarching with our common set of beliefs. This would generate local coordination, trust and employment in the local community.Through this model we are remixing historical Cooperative Organization models with decentralized Web3 needs.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}')}}]);
